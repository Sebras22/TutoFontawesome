## FONT AWESOME 
This project is used to get font awesome working into your html file.<br>

## PREREQUISITES 
This project requires HTML5 and CSS3 set up.<br>

## TYPES OF ICONS OFFERED 
Any type of icons can be used, as much as they are free on the font awesome website.<br>

## INSTALLATION 
No installation needed! That’s great, isn’t it? <br>
Warning: we won’t explain all the Google Homepage Project, only the use of Font awesome in this first readme.md. Don’t get lost in all the code, just look at the right lines.<br>

## USAGE 
First step, go to Font awesome website: https://fontawesome.com/ <br>
Then get the link that allowed you to use their icons in your HTML code:<br>
